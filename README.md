# myGigs app

### "As a self-employed artist whose job never has a regular address from point A to B and whose employer varies from day to day. It's often time-consuming and overwhelming to be sifting through a chain of emails to figure out core information about my next gig.

### This App that solves that problem by creating and storing core details that one needs to know when booking or getting booked in the art business.

### Now I am only a click away from managing my gigs"
